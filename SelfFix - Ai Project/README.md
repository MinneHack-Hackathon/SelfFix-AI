# 🧊 SelfFix AI  
### Repair Before Replace

SelfFix AI is an intelligent DIY appliance diagnostic platform that replicates professional service-agent troubleshooting workflows.  
Instead of immediately calling expensive customer service or replacing appliances, users can diagnose issues, estimate repair feasibility, and understand cost and environmental impact.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

When household appliances break:

- Service visit fees are often close to replacement cost
- Consumers lack transparency into diagnostic workflows
- Many minor issues are repairable but result in unnecessary replacement
- This increases financial burden and electronic waste

There is a clear **information asymmetry** between trained service agents and consumers.

SelfFix AI bridges this gap.
